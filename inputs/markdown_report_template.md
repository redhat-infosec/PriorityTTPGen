## Priority Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Report

### Summary

The following report details the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) used by Threat Actors identified by the { Place holder organization name } Cyber Threat Intelligence Team as having a high intent to compromise { Place holder organization name }. The TTPs are organized according to [MITRE's ATT&CK Navigator](https://attack.mitre.org/). 

### Goals 

The goal of the TTP Prioritization is to identify TTPs that are used multiple times by the same threat actor, and TTPs that are used by multiple threat actors, in order to prioritize detection, threat hunting, and prevention efforts. 

### Methodology 

To identify threat actor activities, first the relevant threat actors must be identified. This process was tracked as the Threat Actor Prioritization (TAP). Once priority threat actors are identified, their activities must also be identified. There are two methods used for identifying Threat Actor activity. the first method involves using [ATT&CK publicly available Threat Actor profiles](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/). The second involves researching the recent activities of the threat actors, preferably using a Threat Intelligence platform such as Recorded Future.
