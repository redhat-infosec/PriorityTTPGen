# Priority Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures 

Priority Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (PTTPs) This repo is a method used by the Red Hat Cyber Threat Intelligence team to prioritize specific TTPs used by Priority Threat Actors (PTA)identified by Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs). It is meant to produce actionable tactical level intelligence products in a easy manner for busy CTI teams. 


## Overview of the process  


To best understand not only what TTPs Priority Threat Actors use, but which TTPs are well covered by Detections or preventative measures in your organizations environment this process can optionally take in an ATT&CK Navigator layer for both Detections and Preventative controls and subtract those scores from the PTTP score. 


## Intelligence Products 

The outputs of the process are placed in the "products" directory and include.

- An overall Priority TTP report.
- Per MITRE platform PTTP reports. 



## Example 

In the example directory an example of a fictitious company, Stellar Electric Cars, an EU-based leader in the electric vehicle (EV) industry. You can find the PIRs for Stellar here [https://red.ht/pir](https://red.ht/pir)
